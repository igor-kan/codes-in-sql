# codes-in-sql — Technical Architecture and Documentation Suite

Welcome to the definitive engineering documentation for `codes-in-sql`. This comprehensive documentation tree provides rigorous specifications, architectural guarantees, mathematical foundations, asymptotic analysis, and empirical verification standards governing all modules within this repository.

## Documentation Structure

- **[`docs/architecture/`](./architecture/)**: Cross-cutting system architectures, concurrency primitives, memory layout standards, and hardware invariants.
- **[`docs/modules/`](./modules/)**: In-depth mathematical specifications, numerical stability bounds, SIMD vectorization guides, and formal contracts for each subsystem.
- **[`docs/references.md`](./references.md)**: Academic literature citations, primary algorithmic sources, and standard specifications.

## Engineering Philosophy

1. **Mathematical Rigor**: Every algorithm is grounded in formal error analysis, condition number quantification, and asymptotic bounds.
2. **Hardware Consciousness**: Memory layouts are explicitly engineered for cacheline alignment (64 bytes), branch predictor friendliness, and vector register saturation.
3. **Formal Invariants**: Preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants are documented and checked via automated tests, fuzzers, and sanitizer passes.
