# Formal Verification Notes: B-Tree Page Splits, GiST & BRIN Indices

## 1. Invariant Assertions and Proof Schema

Verification of `indexing_structures` incorporates proof certificates validating loop termination, array indexing safety, and mathematical correctness:

$$\forall k \in [0, N-1], \quad \text{bound}_{\min} \le A[k] \le \text{bound}_{\max}$$

- **Loop Termination**: Proved via monotonically strictly decreasing variant function $V(i) = N - i$.
- **Index Safety**: Proved by induction: base case $i = 0 < N$; inductive step $i < N \implies i+1 \le N$.

## 2. SMT & Model Checking

Critical logic paths have been modeled in SMT-LIB2 format, with Z3 verifying satisfiability of pre- and post-conditions and absence of counterexamples.
