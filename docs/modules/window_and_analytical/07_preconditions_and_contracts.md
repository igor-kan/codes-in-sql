# Preconditions & Contractual Invariants: Framed Analytical Window Partition Functions

## 1. Formal Contract Specifications

Every callable interface in `window_and_analytical` enforces explicit contract specifications:

- **Requires (Preconditions)**:
  - Input arrays must be non-null and correctly aligned to a 64-byte boundary.
  - Length parameter $N$ must satisfy $N > 0$ and $N < 2^{31} - 1$.
  - Numerical inputs must be finite (not NaN, not $\pm \infty$).
- **Ensures (Postconditions)**:
  - Output values remain within mathematically defined analytical bounds $[y_{\min}, y_{\max}]$.
  - No heap memory leaks occur during routine execution.
- **Loop Invariants**:
  - State indices monotonically increase without underflow or overflow.

## 2. Defensive Assertions

Assertions are enforced in debug and CI builds (`assert(...)`), compiling away to zero overhead in release builds while informing compiler optimization heuristics.
